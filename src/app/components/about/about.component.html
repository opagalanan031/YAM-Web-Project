                            The St. Aloysius Young Adult Ministry is a community composed of people who are at their early stages of
                            adulthood, committed to keep the faith and significance of remaining as a part of the parish community
                            of
                            St. Aloysius. This ministry aims to preserve the presence of young adults who are attending St. Aloysius
                            Parish Church, further building up a bigger family of peers while also strengthening the faith of each
                            individual and providing sincere support in any personal needs and concerns.

                            Though adulthood is known to be a period of transition in each person’s lives due to the upcoming
                            responsibilities to our own families, education, and careers, it is also important for those who are in
                            the
                            Catholic faith to remember the roots of our faith and the reason why we are all here today: our Lord
                            Jesus
                            Christ.

                            With this ministry, individuals who share common struggles and responsibilities can get the chance to
                            gather
                            to share each other’s experiences and provide any support for each member of the ministry family. This
                            is a
                            way of knowing and discovering that you are not alone; a way of finding comfort in each other’s company
                            and
                            away from the struggles of life, and reminding you that you are a vital part of this Universal Church.

                            Thus, through a series of fun and engaging social activities and gatherings with fellow young adults
                            held
                            twice a month, along with participating in our parish community events, we could keep our presence felt,
                            as
                            well as present our service to the Lord, get together as one family, spread the joy to each other,
                            provide
                            mutual care and support, and captivate other fellow young adults to be a part of our family.
